~~Accuse Billy Binary~~
"Come on Billy, I know you're hiding something", you accuse him, "Your story just doesn't feel right. Why don't you just confess? I think you're the one who murdered Mr. Body!"

Billy laughs humourlessly, and says, "Come on. It doesn't feel right? What does that even mean."

"Billy was with me the whole time", Suzy chimes in, "Helping me with a question. How could it have been him?"

Whoops. Looks like Billy was with Suzy Sort when the murder happened. Seems like you might've made a mistake. He is acting a little strange, but the evidence doesn't really add up.

Seems like you might've missed something important.

**THE END**
