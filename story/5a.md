~~Accuse Helga Hex~~

"I know it was you Helga!" you suddenly exclaim, "You were standing near Mr. Body when the lights went out. No one could've gotten to him as quickly as you could've. Just confess, and all of this can be over."

Helga looks at you aghast.

"How could you accuse me of something so horrible?" she says, "Mr. Body was my good friend and colleague. Besides, if I was over here with Mr. Body, how could I have turned off the lights?"

A good question. You hadn't considered that. Her question throws you off balance.

As you're struggling to answer, Helga retorts, saying, "You're awfully quick to throw blame around. Maybe you're just trying cover up your own guilt!"

Uh oh. You look around the room, and others are nodding along. You try to protest weakly, but people have started to yell at this point. Hysteria is taking hold of the classroom. Things are getting out of hand.

Maybe you missed something. An important detail somewhere.

**THE END**
