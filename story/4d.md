~~Talk to Billy directly~~

You approach Billy.

"What do you remember when the lights went out Billy?", you ask him.

He thinks for a minute, and says, "Well, I was over with Suzy Sort at the time, helping her with a problem she was working on. And then suddenly the lights went out, and when they came back on, Mr. Body was lying there."
