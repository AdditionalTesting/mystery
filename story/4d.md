~~Talk to Billy directly~~

You approach Billy, and draw his attention away from the other students he's talking to.

"I'm trying to get to the bottom of what happened here. What do you remember when the lights went out Billy?", you ask him.

He thinks for a minute, and says, "Well, I was over with Suzy Sort at the time, helping her with a problem she was working on. And then suddenly the lights went out, and when they came back on, Mr. Body was lying there."
