~~Get to work helping. Take a look around the room. Look for people and things that look suspicious or stand out. The sooner begun, the sooner done.~~

A murderer! We have to get to the bottom of this. Mr. Body might've been a dweeb, but he deserves justice.

You spend a moment to look around the room. A couple of things catch your eye.

A couple of other instructors are in the room. Helga Hex and Billy Binary. Helga is speaking with Doctor Database next to Mr. Body in a quiet tone. You can't hear what they're saying from here.  Billy is talking to a group of students, maybe trying to comfort them.

The cleaner Danny Decrement is looking around the room nervously, wiping sweat from his forehead with handkerchief. Who uses a handkerchief these days?

Two students are whispering to each other at the back of the room: Annie Algorithm and Suzy Sort.

Mr. Body is lying on the floor with a lead pipe laying beside him.

What do you want to do?
