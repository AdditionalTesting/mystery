~~Accuse Billy, Helga, and Danny together~~

You yell, "Attention everyone! Can I get everyone's attention! I have a theory I'd like to share."

The room quiets down, and everyone turns to face you. You move to the front of the room, to share your deductions with everyone. Reaching into your pocket, you find a children's bubble pipe. You're not sure why you have this, but it certainly adds to your Holmes-like mystique, so you go about smoking it.

"This was a real pickle to solve, but I believe what I'm about to share with all of you will crack this case wide open!" you say dramatically.

"Here we have the murder weapon," you say, pointing to the pipe, "And here, the poor victim," pointing to Mr. Body.

"Now, its not possible that someone in this room would be able to turn out the lights, slay Mr. Body with this pipe, and turn the lights back on, all while without drawing the attention of the students," you deduce, "Therefore, I believe that this is not just a simple murder, but a conspiracy!"

Gasps erupt from the crowd.

"The conspirators worked together to put an end to Mr. Body. And here's how I believe they accomplished this. Firstly, the lights. The only person close enough to the lights at the time of the murder, the only person who could've tampered with the lighting without drawing attention to himself, was none other than Danny Decrement!"

Gasps again.

"Second, the murder itself. At the time of the murder, Mr. Body was by himself at the front of the class. But the person who dunnit must've been close by to strike with something like a lead pipe. Most of the class was sitting at their desks. No way they could've risen in time when the lights went. In fact everyone was either too far away or inconveniently placed except for... Helga Hex!"

Gasps once more.

"Finally, while we know who handled the lights, and who did the deed itself, there's no way they could've done all this without being witnessed by anyone. After all, this room is full of people. No way, unless someone was running interference for them. Someone by the name of... Billy Binary!"

A final round of gasps.

You yell, "Police, take them away!"

A group of police officers who just happened to be nearby come running in, and arrest the suspects promptly, for some reason without conducting an investigation of their own.

Your classmates cheer your cleverness. What a smart cookie you are! Maybe if this coding thing doesn't work out, you can consider being a Private Investigator.

**THE END**
